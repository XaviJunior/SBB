## Context

In the scope of the **Big Scale Analytics** course at HEC Lausanne, Team SBB is happy to present its two projects.

## Project 1: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)

The goal of this project is to introduce the subject of XAI and to exemplify it by showcasing several Python libraries: LIME, SHAP, ELI5, and XAI. We worked with data about Kickstarter used in a [previous project](https://github.com/tbacha/DMML2019_Team_Apple).

### Files

* `Team_SBB_project_1_Explainable_AI.ipynb`: main notebook, which contains a link to our YouTube video, an introduction about XAI, presentation + examples with code for each of the libraries mentioned above, and a conclusion.
  * **NB**: it is advised to run this notebook in *Google Colaboratory* for two reasons: 1) all package installations work properly, and 2) plots that rely on JavaScript are visible.
* For the notebook to run in Colab, the three files listed below must be uploaded manually. 
  * `cleaning.py`: cleaned version of the Kickstarter dataset
  * `custom_functions_SBB.py`: new version of the `custom_functions` module, updated for XAI purposes
  * `model_evaluation_utils.py`: useful module containing a mix of different performance metrics, by Dipanjan Sarkar (Google)

## Project 2: TBD
