## Context

In the scope of the **Big Scale Analytics** course at HEC Lausanne, Team SBB is happy to present its two projects.

## Project 1: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)

The goal of this project is to introduce the subject of XAI and exemplify it by showcasing several Python libraries: LIME, ELI5, Skater, and SHAP. We worked with data about Kickstarter used in a [previous project](https://github.com/tbacha/DMML2019_Team_Apple).

### Structure

* `Team_SBB_project_1_Explainable_AI.ipynb`: main notebook
* `/_kickstarter_data`: dataset and relevant notebooks/Python functions that we extracted from the GitHub linked above 
* `/documents`: contains our video (also uploaded to YouTube) and PowerPoint presentation


## Project 2: TBD
